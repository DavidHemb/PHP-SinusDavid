<h2 style = "text-align: center;" >There is no one definitive answer to this question, as there is no clear consensus on who actually invented skateboarding. However, there are a few popular theories about who may have started skateboarding first.

One theory suggests that it was Californian surfers in the 1950s who adapted their surfboards to create the first skateboards. Another theory suggests that it was American children in the 1960s who were inspired by the surfing craze and created their own DIY versions of surfboards to ride on land.

Whatever the true origins of skateboarding may be, it is clear that it has become a hugely popular activity all over the world, enjoyed by people of all ages.</h2>
<h1 style = "text-align: center; font-weight: 900;" >HOW DID SKATEBOARDING BEGIN?</h2>
<h2 style = "text-align: center;" >The first recorded skateboarding trick was done by professional surfers in California. They wanted to find something to do when the waves were flat. They attached roller skate wheels to a piece of wood and rode it down the sidewalk. Skateboarding quickly became popular with kids all over America.

In the early 1970s, the first skateboards were made out of plastic. These boards were not very strong and often broke. In 1975, a new type of skateboard was invented. It was made out of fiberglass and had metal wheels. This new type of board was much stronger and more durable.

Skateboarding continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1980s and 1990s. New tricks were invented and new skateboarding competitions were created. Today, skateboarding is a popular sport all over the world. Millions of people enjoy skateboarding as a hobby or a form of exercise. Who knows what the future of skateboarding will bring?</h2>
